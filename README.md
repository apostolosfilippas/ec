# E-Commerce

## üìö Description
This is the hands-on portin of our E-Commerce class
- We will be using Python
- We will copver topics from basic data manipulation to advanced experimental design.

My sole hope is that this will help you get your hands dirty with Python.


## üìã Prerequisites 
- Please read [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jUiWn5Q7L2bPBx7yrEfOYs7Cy5U-pQGrA9VJSkVC5Bs/edit?usp=sharing) to get started
- Make sure that Python is installed in your system
