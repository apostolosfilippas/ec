    "\n",
    "1. First we'll run our first cell and execute some code\n",
    "2. Then we'll explain what the idea of a kernel is and why we need to use it to work with jupyter notebooks\n",

    "I recommend using the [Jupyter Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) that ships with VS Code to run these notebooks. \n",
    "\n",

    "## Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important** : Since we can execute code cell by cell, it's often useful to break up our code into multiple cells so that we can iterate and test different aspects of our code without having to run the entire snippet. This makes it easy to work with more complex logic and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook works by connecting to a \"kernel\" - which is essentially a Python interpreter running in the background. When you run a cell, the code is sent to this kernel for execution, and the results are sent back to display in your notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the kernel as the \"engine\" that powers your notebook - it maintains the state of your variables and executes your code, while the notebook itself is just the interface you use to write code and see results. \n",
