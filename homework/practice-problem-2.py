## Practice Problem 2
##########################

# In the homes.csv dataset, do the following:
# 1. compute the average and median home value per sqft for homes built after 1990
# 2. compute the average and median home value per sqft for every city that has more
#    than a total 1000 houses (for all houses, not only built after 1990)
# 3. produce a dataset that only has houses that have value higher than the median value
#    of houses within their cities

# Hint: You'll need to import pandas and work with DataFrames
# import pandas as pd
# df_homes = pd.read_csv("data/homes.csv")
